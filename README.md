# WebApp-Pentest-Training

### Overview

In this training, we will learn about how to perform penetration testing. Although the training title is called WebApp Pentesting (which we will strictly follow OWASP Top 10 model). Besides, we will perform all the require enumeration techniques and privilege escalations (both linux and window machines), and we will do simple buffer overflow attack as well (if time permit us. Of course, if we know little about assembly language a little in prior, it could help us tremendously to understand buffer overflow).


### Target Audience

- Developers, and Enthusiasts are most welcome!

### Agenda

1. Lab Setup
    - We will either use Kali Linux as our attacking machine or we will explicitly install every tools which we required in our host operating system. (I highly recommend to have a Debian based host machine, however it is not absolute necessity).
    - Virtualbox & Virtualbox Extension
    - Different Adapters
      - Bridge
      - NAT
      - Host Only
    - Vulnerable Machines from vulhub site
      - Target: We will do at least 5 machines from there
      - What the hackthebox.eu
      - What is tryhackme.com
      - OSCP vs CEH certifications

2. Reconnaissance
    - Information Gathering
      - Manually
      - Scanning
        - nmap (open source and free)
        - nikto (open source and free)
        - gobuster (open source and free)
        - AutoRecon (open source and free)
        - wpscan/joomscan (there are drupal and other cms scanner available too)

    - Assessing Vulnerabilities
      - Using Google
      - nmap

4. Finding Exploit
    - exploit-db or searchxploit
    - Note: sometimes we might need to modify the exploit a little

5. Privilege Escalation
    - Linux Privilege Escalation
    - Window Privilege Escalation

6. Cleaning stage
