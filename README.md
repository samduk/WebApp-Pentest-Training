# WebApp-Pentest-Training

### Overview

In this training, we will learn about how to perform penetration testing. Although the training title is called WebApp Pentesting (which we will strictly follow OWASP Top 10 model). Besides, we will perform all the require enumeration techniques and privilege escalations (both linux and window machines), and we will do simple buffer overflow attack as well (if time permit us. Of course, if we know little about assembly language a little in prior, it could help us tremendously to understand buffer overflow).


### Target Audience
